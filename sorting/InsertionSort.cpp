/*
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list. It is like sorting playing cards in your hands. You split the cards into two groups: the sorted cards and the unsorted cards. Then, you pick a card from the unsorted group and put it in the right place in the sorted group.

 - Start with the second element as the first element is assumed to be sorted.

 - Compare the second element with the first if the second is smaller then swap them.

 - Move to the third element, compare it with the first two, and put it in its correct position

 - Repeat until the entire array is sorted.
